# Calculator

A NailFec calculator project **written from scratch** without relying on other advanced libraries.
Dedicated to implementing rich functions with simple and fast input methods.

## features

The NailFec calculator was originally designed to simplify the process of calculating analytic geometry, space vectors
and other topics in high school mathematics. The requirement was to be able to get answers that preserve root signs and
fractions **with faster input**. It also had to be **fully functional**.

Why choose NailFec's calculator?

1. **No dependencies on other libraries, all algorithms are in the repository**
    1. Functionality is highly customisable and not limited by third party libraries. Easily change input methods,
       built-in formulas for other operations, etc. by changing a few lines of code.
    2. You can easily modify the algorithms and replace the running logic yourself if you think some processes are
       cumbersome or have high time complexity.
    3. Covers GCD, Recursion, Lucas Theorem, AST, Tree, Fast Power, Matrix Multiplication and other related algorithms
       for learning and communication.

2. **Simple input**
    1. The logic of entering formulas and defining variables is simple, fast and easy, even some operations, such as
       root sign and vector definition, don't require the shift key.
    2. Open a terminal, open a web page or build a project, no need to do a long installation, you can run it quickly.

3. **Powerful functions**
    1. Supports vector operations, matrix operations, solving equations, function lists, simplifying formulas with
       parameters, etc.

## functions

The currently supported functions are as follows:

### Precise calculation

### scientific calculation (retaining fractions and square roots)

### simplifying formulas

### solving equations

### vector operations

### function list

### matrix calculation

## disadvantages

Since the author has very little programming experience and very little free time at present, the algorithms in the
project may not be optimal (the time complexity may be extremely high) and the code style may be inconsistent and
irregular.
